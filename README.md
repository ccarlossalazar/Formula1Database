<h3>Course Description</h3>
<hr>
<p>This course prepares students to effectively manage data through a relational database
management system (RDBMS), a query language and relevant tools. Fundamental
database theories are introduced but the emphasis is on practical and hands-on learning
experience. Various topics are covered including data modeling, database development
life cycle, entity-relationship (ER) modeling and database design, relational models,
normalization, structured query language (SQL), SQL queries, functions as well as
advanced topics such as indexes and query performance, advanced queries and Python
programming with databases. MySQL, the industry leading open-source RDBMS and the
graphical user interface (GUI) and development tool MySQL Workbench are practically
introduced and used.</p>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Students are tasked with identifying a relational dataset comprising more than 12 tables to design and implement a comprehensive relational database. The project involves creating a database schema and an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram that clearly illustrates the relationships between entities.

Using tools like MySQL Workbench and Excel, students will clean the data and develop advanced queries to extract meaningful insights. The projectâ€™s goal is to tell a cohesive and engaging story to the audience by presenting findings in a logical and compelling flow. Visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables will be employed to enhance understanding of the data.

Students will incorporate visualization tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Python, R, or other relevant software to create impactful visual representations. These queries should demonstrate extensive use of:
<ul>
<li>Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY, etc.)</li>
<li>Comparison Operators (=, <, >, <=, >=)</li>
<li>Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT) where applicable</li>
<li>JOINs</li>
<li>Subqueries</li>
<li>Filtering with WHERE Clauses to refine your results</li>
</ul>
</p>
